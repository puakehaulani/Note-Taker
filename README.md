## About the Project

This is an app for writing, viewing, and deleting notes. It uses an express backend to save and retrieve the notes from a JSON file that acts as the database. The server was created and run to localhost with node.js.

## Usage

Use this app to stay organized and get ideas and notes out of your brain. These notes can be revisited later, and deleted when they are no longer needed. The notes are saved to a JSON file, so they can be recalled more reliably than using localstorage.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

### 1. Installation

Run the following command in your terminal

    npm i

### 2. Launching

Start the server in the terminal by running the following command

    npm run watch

In the browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080

## Testing

Run the following command in your terminal

    npm test
